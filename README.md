ChromePass
==========

A packaged Chrome application to read KeyPass database files. This project is based on the code for
[BrowsePass](https://bitbucket.org/namn/browsepass/overview), but aims to provide Chrome-specific
features not provided by the web-only version, such as:

 - Local filesystem access
 - Clipboard integration
 - Automatic website password entry
 - ...and more!
